\section*{RESEARCH INTERESTS}

My work focusses on natural language processing applications (e.g. machine translation, parsing and paraphrasing) with a special focus on unsupervised learning of language structure. 
My research interests and experience span several disciplines including automata theory and formal grammars, machine learning,  Bayesian statistics, deep generative models, and global optimisation.

\section*{TEACHING}

%\begin{description}
I have extensive teaching experience on various topics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian methods for NLP
	\item approximate probabilistic inference: Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference
	\item weighted automata and grammars, semirings, and deductive systems
	\item statistical and neural approaches to natural language processing
\end{itemize}

Since 2015, I coordinate, design, and implement MSc and BSc courses offered at UvA.
%Since 2015, I coordinate and design a course on natural language processing offered at UvA as part of a master's programme in artificial intelligence.\footnote{\url{https://uva-slpl.github.io/nlp2/}}
%At UvA, I also offered 6EC courses to master of logic students, as well as BA projects.

I have recently developed a tutorial on variational inference and deep generative models for NLP audiences. This is a joint effort with Philip Schulz, and we have been taking this tutorial (or parts of it) to diverse audiences at universities (e.g. Melbourne, Monash, Macquarie, and Amsterdam) and companies (e.g. Amazon, Naver Labs). I am happy to announce that the tutorial has been selected for presentation at ACL 2018 in Melbourne. For more information check our schedule and available resources: \url{http://wilkeraziz.github.io/vitutorial}.

%Experience in research and development of SMT algorithms, e.g. grammar extraction (via pattern matching) and decoding (optimisation and sampling), MT evaluation as well as other NLP applications such as sentence- and word-alignment, word-sense disambiguation, lexical substitution and paraphrasing through pivoting. 

%Experience in exploiting machine learning techniques to model natural language tasks such as named-entity recognition and semantic role labelling.
