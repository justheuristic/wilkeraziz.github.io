\section*{RESEARCH INTERESTS}

My work focusses on natural language processing applications (e.g. machine translation, parsing and paraphrasing) with a special focus on unsupervised learning of language structure. 
My research interests and experience span several disciplines including automata theory and formal grammars, machine learning,  Bayesian statistics, deep generative models, and global optimisation.

\section*{TEACHING}

%\begin{description}
I have extensive teaching experience on various topics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item probabilistic graphical models
	\item Bayesian methods for NLP
	\item approximate probabilistic inference: Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and variational inference
	\item statistical and neural approaches to machine translation
	\item neural network models for machine translation
\end{itemize}

Since 2015, I coordinate and design a course on natural language processing offered at UvA as part of a master's programme in artificial intelligence.\footnote{\url{https://uva-slpl.github.io/nlp2/}}
At UvA, I have offered 6EC courses to master of logic students on Bayesian grammar induction and parsing as deduction.
For a complete list of courses and projects I have offered including available material and project outcomes, please refer to \url{http://wilkeraziz.github.io/teaching.html}.

%Experience in research and development of SMT algorithms, e.g. grammar extraction (via pattern matching) and decoding (optimisation and sampling), MT evaluation as well as other NLP applications such as sentence- and word-alignment, word-sense disambiguation, lexical substitution and paraphrasing through pivoting. 

%Experience in exploiting machine learning techniques to model natural language tasks such as named-entity recognition and semantic role labelling.
