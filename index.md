I am a *Research Associate* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with [Prof {{ site.ksimaanstyle }}]({{ site.khalil_simaan }}).
My work focusses on better inference for statistical machine translation, particularly, algorithms
which enable inference under complex models.

I am a member of the [Statistical Language Processing and Learning Lab][SLPLL], at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation][ILLC].

I previously worked at the [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) with [Dr Lucia Specia]({{ site.lucia_specia }}) on the [MODIST project]({{ site.modist_url }}) which aims at making SMT discourse-aware.



Here is my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.cv }}).
