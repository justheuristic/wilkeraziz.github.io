I am a *Research Associate* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with [Prof {{ site.ksimaanstyle }}]({{ site.khalil_simaan }}).
My work focusses on natural language processing problems such as machine translation, word alignment, and paraphrasing. I am interested in the intersection between various disciplines such as formal languages, machine learning, approximate inference, global optimisation, and computational linguistics. 

Recently, I've developed quite an interested in deep generative models for structure prediction. The idea is to employ the flexibility of neural networks as density estimators while retaining some of the interpretability inherent to graphical models. In particular, I pursue combinations of statistical and logical views to natural language learning problems, that is to say that I like the idea of learning continuous representations (typical of deep learning) along with more traditional discrete generalisations (such as trees and graphs common in linguistics).

I am a member of the [Statistical Language Processing and Learning Lab][SLPLL], at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation][ILLC].

Here is my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.cv }}) and here is a quick [background](pages/background).
