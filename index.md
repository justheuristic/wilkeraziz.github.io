I am a *Research Associate* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with [Prof {{ site.ksimaanstyle }}]({{ site.khalil_simaan }}).
My work focusses on better inference for machine translation, particularly, algorithms
which enable inference under complex models. I also work on alignment models and paraphrasing.

Recently, I'm interested in deep generative models for structure prediction tasks beyond sequence labelling. The idea is to employ the flexibility of neural networks for feature induction while retaining some of the interpretability inherent to graphical models.

I am a member of the [Statistical Language Processing and Learning Lab][SLPLL], at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation][ILLC].

Here in my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.cv }}) and here is a quick [background](pages/background).

If you need to find me try Science Park 107 (F2.11).
