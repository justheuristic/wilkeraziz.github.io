I am a *Research Associate* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with [Prof {{ site.ksimaanstyle }}]({{ site.khalil_simaan }}).
My work focusses on natural language processing problems such as machine translation, word alignment, and paraphrasing. My interests sit at the intersection of various disciplines (e.g. formal languages, machine learning, approximate inference, global optimisation, and computational linguistics). 


I pursue combinations of statistical and logical views to NLP problems, that is to say that I like the idea of learning continuous representations (typical of deep learning) along with more traditional discrete generalisations (such as trees and graphs in linguistics).


Recently, I've developed quite an interest in deep generative models, write to me if you are looking for a project.



If you need to find me try Science Park 107 (F2.11).
