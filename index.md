I am a *Research Associate* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with [Prof {{ site.ksimaanstyle }}]({{ site.khalil_simaan }}).
My work focusses on better inference for statistical machine translation, particularly, algorithms
which enable inference under complex models. I also work on alignment models and paraphrasing.


I am a member of the [Statistical Language Processing and Learning Lab][SLPLL], at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation][ILLC].

Here in my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.cv }}) and here is a quick [background](pages/background).

If you need to find me try Science Park 107 (F2.11).
