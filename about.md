I am currently a *Research Associate* at the University of Sheffield working with [Dr. Lucia Specia]({{ site.lucia_specia }}).
My work focusses on better inference for statistical machine translation, particularly, algorithms
which enable inference under complex models.
I am currently employed as part of the [MODIST project]({{ site.modist_url }}) where we are pushing SMT towards discourse-aware models.

Have a look at my [departmental page]({{ site.dcs_page }}).
