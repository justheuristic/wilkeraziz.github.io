I am a *Research Associate* at the University of Amsterdam working with [Prof Khalil Sima`an]({{ site.khalil_simaan }}).
My work focusses on better inference for statistical machine translation, particularly, algorithms
which enable inference under complex models.

I previously worked at the University of Sheffield with [Dr Lucia Specia]({{ site.lucia_specia }}) on the [MODIST project]({{ site.modist_url }}) which aims at making SMT discourse-aware.

Have a look at my old [departmental page]({{ site.dcs_page }}).

Here is my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ site.cv }}).
