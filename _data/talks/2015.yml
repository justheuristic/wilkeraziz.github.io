    Guest lecture for Jelle Zuidema's course on <a href="http://wzuidema.humanities.uva.nl/unsupervised-language-learning-2015/">Unsupervised Language Learning</a> at UvA. In this one hour talk, I present sampling methods and their role in performing MLE and/or posterior inference with special attention to the case of parsing.
