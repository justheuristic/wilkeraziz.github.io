  about: >
    Every song in this album is a unique experience. Live guitar performances by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden_Powell_de_Aquino">Baden Powell</a> are unbelievable (check on youtube). My favourite track is <i>Canto de Ossanha</i>.
  extra: >
    Vinicius was fascinated by African culture, particularly, religion which features in this album all over. Baden and Vinicius shared an apartment during the making of this album. The lyrics are due to Vinicius, the inspired guitar is due to Baden Powell.
    These songs have all been revisited and recorded by modern artists. The version by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BooGO0hrg8w">Monica Salmaso and Paulo Bellinati</a> is inspired.

    I think I like side one better than side two, but the album is great as a whole. My favourite tracks are probably <i>Triste Bahia</i> and <i>Nine out of ten</i>.

    Caetano Veloso recorded this album in London at a time when Brazil wasn't a very welcoming place for artists who were not willing to sing whatever the military wanted them singing. The title is a reference to a song Caetano refused to compose for the military about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Amazonian_Highway">Trans-Amazonian</a>.

    No doubt my favourite track is <i>White Rabbit</i>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Slick">Grace Slick</a>'s powerful voice  doesn't go unnoticed in <i>She has Funny Cars</i>.

    If I had to choose one of Joāo Gilberto's albums, this would be it.
