    Iâ€™m organising Natural Language Processing II at UvA (the course is focused on machine translation). This is the third edition which I organise, the first one was in the spring of 2015. 

    The course is organised in three blocks

    * Unsupervised word alignments: directed models (EM estimation and VB) and undirected models (MLE via gradient-based optimisation)
    * Statistical machine translation: (hierarchical) phrase-based MT (linear models), latent-variable CRF for hierarhical PBSMT
    * Neural machine translation: fully supervised sequence to sequence models, deep generative models

    4 weeks course on Bayesian inference for PCFGs, here is a list of the topics covered:

    * [Parsing as weighted deduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cmp-lg/9404008.pdf) (CKY, Earley)
    * [Inside-Outside and ancestral sampling](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J/J99/J99-4004.pdf)
    * [Maximum likelihood of PCFGs via EM](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/665/lari-young.pdf)
    * Introduction to Dirichlet distribution and related processes
    * [Bayesian inference for PCFG](/Users/waziz/workspace/github/nlp2/img/lectures/biparsing.png): Gibbs sampler and collapsed Metropolis-Hastings sampler

    My student [Daan van Stigt](//github.com/daandouwe) did an excellent job! Check his amazing [notebooks](//github.com/daandouwe/Probabilistic-modelling-with-PCFG).
