  about: >
    In 2009 and again in 2012, I spent some
    wonderful time working under Marc's supervision as an intern at XRCE.
    I also had the honour of having him in the supervisory team of my PhD studies.
  extra: >
    Marc inspired my taste for inference/decoding problems.
    Unintentionaly, he also inspired me to use Moleskine plain notebooks.
