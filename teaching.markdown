# Spring 2016

I'm organising [Natural Language Processing II]({{ site.url }}/uva-nlp2/) at UvA (the course is focused on *machine translation* though).
This is the second edition which I organise, the first one was in the spring of 2015.
I count with the help of a great [team]({{ site.url }}//uva-nlp2/instructors.html) of colleagues.
