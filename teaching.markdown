# Courses

## Natural Language Processing II

I'm organising [Natural Language Processing II](//uva-slpl.github.io/nlp2/) at UvA (the course is focused on *machine translation*).
This is the third edition which I organise, the first one was in the spring of 2015.

## Bayesian PCFG

In March 2017, I offered a 4 weeks course on Bayesian PCFGs, here is a lits of the topics covered:

* Parsing as weighted deduction (CKY, Earley)
* Algorithms: Inside-Outside, Viterbi, ancestral sampling
* Maximum likelihood of PCFGs via EM
* Dirichlet priors
* Bayesian PCFG: Gibbs sampler
* Bayesian PCFG: collapsed Metropolis-Hastings sampler

My student [DAan van Stigt](//github.com/daandouwe) did an excellent job! Check his amazing [notebooks](//github.com/daandouwe/Probabilistic-modelling-with-PCFG).


## Sampling from PCFGs

In the spring of 2015, I offered a course to Master of Logic students on [parsing as deduction and sampling from PCFGs](resources/courses/MoL-pcfg-sampling.pdf) (check some of our [notebooks](https://github.com/wilkeraziz/notebooks/tree/master/MoL_June15)). 

# Projects

## Featurised EM

In the spring of 2016, I am offered a BA project on [feature-rich unsupervised alignment models](resources/courses/BA-featurised-EM.pdf). My student [Guido Linders](//esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f1886233032.pdf) did a great job ([thesis](//esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f1886233032.pdf), [code](//github.com/wilkeraziz/lola))!

## Slice sampling from PCFGs

In the spring of 2015, I offered a BA project on [slice sampling from PCFGs](resources/courses/BA-slice-sampling.pdf). My student [Iason de Bondt](//nl.linkedin.com/in/iason-de-bondt-3676ba101) did a great job ([thesis](//esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f1550974112.pdf), [code](//github.com/wilkeraziz/pcfg-sampling))!
