# Courses

## Spring 2016

I'm organising [Natural Language Processing II]({{ site.url }}/uva-nlp2/) at UvA (the course is focused on *machine translation* though).
This is the second edition which I organise, the first one was in the spring of 2015.
I count with the help of a great [team]({{ site.url }}/uva-nlp2/instructors.html) of colleagues.

## June 2015

Crash course offered to Master of Logic students on [parsing as deduction and sampling from PCFGs](resources/courses/MoL-pcfg-sampling.pdf). 

# Projects

## Featurised EM

This spring (2016), I am offering a BA project on [featurised EM](resources/courses/BA-featurised-EM.pdf).

## Slice sampling from PCFGs

In the spring of 2015, I offered a BA project on [slice sampling from PCFGs](resources/courses/BA-slice-sampling.pdf). My student [Iason de Bondt](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/iason-de-bondt-3676ba101) did a great [job](https://github.com/wilkeraziz/pcfg-sampling)!
