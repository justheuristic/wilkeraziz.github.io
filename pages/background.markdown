Here you find a bit more about my background and personal life.

# Work

From November 2013 to December 2014, I worked at the [University of Sheffield](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) with [Dr Lucia Specia]({{ site.lucia_specia }}) on the [MODIST project]({{ site.modist_url }}) which aims at making SMT discourse-aware.

I obtained my PhD from the University of Wolverhampton (UK) in February 2014.

I was twice an intern at [XRCE](http://www.xrce.xerox.com) (France), first as an undergraduate and then as a PhD candidate, where I had the great pleasure to work with [Marc Dymetman](http://www.xrce.xerox.com/About-XRCE/People/Marc-Dymetman).

In 2010, I obtained my BSc degree in Computer Engineering from the Engineering School of the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil).

# Personal 

I really enjoy playing the guitar (ask me for a Brazilian tune from the 60s) and I've been told I mix great cocktails (ask me for a classic). Recently, I've been collecting cocktail glassware and I bought a turntable (and now you know what to give me on November 13 &#x1F609;).
